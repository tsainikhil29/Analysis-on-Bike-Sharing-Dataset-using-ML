ðŸš² Bike Sharing Prediction â€“ Regression Project
This project focuses on predicting bike rental demand using machine learning regression models. The dataset contains daily rental records along with weather, seasonal, and calendar-related information.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Domain: Transportation / Demand Forecasting
Problem Statement: Predict daily bike rental demand based on seasonal, weather, and calendar-related features.
Dataset Size: 731 rows Ã— 16 features (2011â€“2012)
Target Variable: cnt (total rentals = casual + registered)

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Analyze factors influencing bike rental demand.
Identify usage patterns of casual vs registered users.
Apply regression models to predict demand.
Support decision-making for bike allocation and resource planning.

ðŸ”¬ Technical Approach
Data Preprocessing â€“ Cleaning, handling outliers, one-hot encoding, scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Seasonal trends, working day effects, weather impact.
Model Implementation â€“ Linear Regression, KNN, SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost), and ANN.
Model Comparison â€“ Evaluated using RÂ², MAE, MSE, RMSE.

ðŸ“ˆ Best Accuracy
âœ¨ Linear Regression â€“ RÂ² Score: 0.83 (Train-Test Split: 60:40) âœ¨
